title: Explainers Introduction
description: All about the explainers sections where we talk about features of Astro in more depth.
---

Most of what I’ve written so far are tutorials and guides. But, there is a third important thing. I wanted to take the time to explain some of the features of Astro that may not be obvious to people.

The Astro docs are awesome and explain so much. Yet, we have to acknowledge that they are still written for pro devs. This website is for people like me who are still new to these technologies. There is an audience for this. As I see in the Astro Discord people who are getting started need help with some things that I’ve figured out. I have been able to answer a few support questions and that always feels good.

The following sections will cover a few areas.

This includes:

- TypeScript
- Using props to create flexible components
- How to use Reference in content collections
- Custom CSS in Tailwind
- Difference between getCollection and collectionEntry

These were all discoveries as I was putting my websites together. So far, I’ve built five sites with Astro. This has given me a lot of experience working in all these areas. Enough that I have some wisdom to impart.

I worry about how people might judge my knowledge as someone who does this as a hobby and not a career. I know some people struggle with the same things that I do. So there is worth in sharing things with others if it helps them even a little bit. I find that what works for us with less skill sometimes also helps the professionals!

Let me know if you find any of these helpful. You are always free to contact me if you have any questions about this guide or otherwise. Reach me at [suzza@susansilver.net](mailto:suzza@susansilver.net).
